                  =================================
                  IEEE Grid 2008 CALL FOR PAPERS
                  =================================

Grid computing enables the sharing of distributed computing and data
resources such as processing, networking and storage capacity to create
a cohesive resource environment for executing distributed applications
in e-Science and businesses. The Grid conference series is an annual
international meeting that brings together a community of researchers,
developers, practitioners, and user involved with Grid technology. The
objective of the meeting is to serve as both the premier venue for
presenting foremost research results in the area and as a forum for
introducing and exploring new concepts. The conference will feature
invited talks, pre-coordinated workshops and refereed paper presentations.
Grid 2008 welcomes paper and poster submissions on innovative work from
researchers in academia, industry and government describing original
research work in grid computing. Previous events in this series have
been successful in attracting high quality papers and a wide international
participation. 

Grid 2008 is hosted in the Science Park City of Tsukuba which is only
50km away from downtown Tokyo and only 90min bus ride from Tokyo/Narita
International Airport. Your will experience well harmonized surroundings
of wide variety of High Technologies and nature. 

 2008 IEEE International Conference on Cluster Computing (http://www.cluster2008
.org/) will be held on the same days and location as the Grid 2008.  CFP
of Cluster 2008 is available at the home page..
