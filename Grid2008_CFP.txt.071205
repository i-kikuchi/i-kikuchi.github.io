Call for Papers

The 9th IEEE/ACM International Conference on Grid Computing (Grid 2008)
Tsukuba, Japan
Sep 29 (Mon) -- Oct 1 (Wed), 2008
http://www.grid2008.org/

=========================================
Grid computing enables the sharing of distributed computing and data
resources such as processing, network bandwidth and storage capacity
to create a cohesive resource environment for executing distributed
applications.  The Grid conference series is an annual international
meeting that brings together a community of researchers, developers,
practitioners, and user involved with Grid technology. The objective
of the meeting is to serve as both the premier venue for presenting
foremost research results in the area and as a forum for introducing
and  exploring new concepts. The conference will feature invited
talks, workshops, and refereed paper presentations. Previous events
in this series have been successful in attracting high quality
papers and a wide international participation. This ninth event will
be co-located with the Cluster 2008 conference.
